      <p>
        Transaction-order-manipulation attacks have become extremelycommon in public blockchains such as Ethereum, costing
        hundreds of millions of dollars. In these blockchains, a miner can unilaterally determine the order of transactions
        inside a block, and this ordering is not checked by other users, leaving room for the miner to manipulate the order for its
        own benefit. This gap is also evident from existing security results for permissionless blockchains. As prime examples,
        the breakthrough work of <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/765.pdf"><span style="color:#7d3494e5">Garay et
        al.</span></a> and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/454.pdf"><span style="color:#7d3494e5">Pass et al.</span></a> showed the
        security properties of consistency and liveness for Nakamotoâ€™s seminal proof-of-workprotocol. However, consistency and
        liveness do not provide any guarantees on the relationship between the order in which transactions arrive into the network and the
        finalized order in the ledger.

      <p>
        As a solution, a recent paper by <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/269.pdf"><span style="color:#7d3494e5">Kelkar
            et al.</span></a> introduced a third useful property for consensus protocols:
        (transaction)-order-fairness, which proposes a strong relationship between the transaction arrival order and their
        order in the ledger. Their model was limited to the classical (permissioned) setting however, where the set of
        protocol nodes is fixed a priori, and does not fit well for permissionless environments where order-manipulation attacks have
        been most prominent. In this work, we initiate the investigation of order-fairness in the permissionless setting and
        design two protocols that realize this new property addition to standard requirements of consistency and livenesss.
        The key insight behind our protocols in providing order-fairness is that a miner can no longer unilaterally determine
        ordering and proposals from many miners are combined in a fair way to construct the finalized ordering. As a simple
        but unexpected corollary, we show that any fair ordering protocol achieves a powerful zero-block confirmation property,
        through which honest transactions can be securely confirmed <span style="color:#030303e5"><em>even before they are
        included in any block</em></span>.

      <p> 
        An important feature of Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains is full dynamic availability, allowing
        miners to go online and offline while requiring only 50% of the online miners to be honest.
        Existing Proof-of-Stake (PoS) such as <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889.pdf"><span style="color:#7d3494e5">Ouroboros</span></a> and 
        <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/919.pdf"><span style="color:#7d3494e5">Snow White</span></a>, Proof-of-Space and related protocols are able to achieve
        this property only partially, either requiring the additional assumption
        that adversary nodes are online from the beginning and no new adversary nodes come online
        afterwards, or use additional trust assumptions for newly joining nodes. We propose a new
        PoS protocol PoSAT which can provably achieve dynamic availability fully without any additional
        assumptions. The protocol is based on the longest chain and uses a Verifiable Delay Function
        for the block proposal lottery to provide an arrow of time.

        </div>   
      <p>
        The security analysis of the protocol
        draws on the recently proposed technique of Nakamoto blocks as well as the theory of branching
        random walks. An additional feature of PoSAT is the complete unpredictability of who will get to 
        propose a block next, even by the winner itself. This unpredictability is at the same level of 
        PoW protocols, and is stronger than that of existing PoS protocols using Verifiable Random
        Functions.

      <p>
        The concept of a blockchain was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto to maintain a distributed ledger for an electronic payment
        system, Bitcoin. In addition to its security, important performance measures of a blockchain protocol are its
        transaction throughput, confirmation latency and confirmation reliability. These measures are limited by two underlying
        physical network attributes: communication capacity and speed-of-light propagation delay. Existing systems operate far
        away from these physical limits.

        In this work we introduce Prism, a new blockchain protocol, which can provably achieve
        1) security against up to 50% adversarial hashing power; 2) optimal throughput up to the capacity C of the network; 3)
        confirmation latency for honest transactions proportional to the propagation delay D, with confirmation error
        probability exponentially small in the bandwidth-delay product CD; 4) eventual total ordering of all transactions. Our
        approach to the design of this protocol is based on deconstructing the blockchain into its basic functionalities and
        systematically scaling up these functionalities to approach their physical limits.

      <h1 style="font-size:24px;">I. Efficient Peer-to-Peer Network Design for Blockchains</h1>
    
      <p>
        A key performance metric in blockchains is the latency between when a transaction is broadcast and when it is confirmed
        (the so-called, confirmation latency). While improvements in consensus techniques can lead to lower confirmation
        latency, a fundamental lower bound on confirmation latency is the propagation latency of messages through the underlying
        peer-to-peer (p2p) network (in Bitcoin, the propagation latency is several tens of seconds). The  de facto p2p
        protocol used by Bitcoin and other blockchains is based on random connectivity: each node connects to a random subset of
        nodes. The induced p2p network topology can be highly suboptimal since it neglects geographical distance, differences in
        bandwidth, hash-power and computational abilities across peers.
      </p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        We present Perigee, a decentralized algorithm that automatically learns an efficient p2p topology tuned to the
        aforementioned network heterogeneities, purely based on peers' interactions with their neighbors.
        Motivated by the literature on the multi-armed bandit problem, Perigee optimally balances the tradeoff between retaining
        connections to known well-connected neighbors, and exploring new connections to previously-unseen neighbors.
        Experimental evaluations show that Perigee reduces the latency to broadcast by 33%.
        Lastly Perigee is simple, computationally lightweight, adversary-resistant, and compatible with the selfish interests of
        peers, making it an attractive p2p protocol for blockchains.

      <h1 style="font-size:24px;">I. Coding theory for blockchains</h1>
      <p>
        Today's blockchains do not scale in a meaningful sense. As more nodes join the system, the efficiency of the system
        (computation, communication, and storage) degrades, or at best stays constant. A leading idea for enabling blockchains
        to scale efficiency is the notion of sharding: different subsets of nodes handle different portions of the blockchain,
        thereby reducing the load for each individual node. However, existing sharding proposals achieve efficiency scaling by
        compromising on trust - corrupting the nodes in a given shard will lead to the permanent loss of the corresponding
        portion of data. We observe that sharding is similar to replication coding, which is known to be inefficient and fragile
        in the coding theory community. 
        <div class="row">

          </div>
        </div>
        In this paper, we demonstrate a new protocol for coded storage and computation in
        blockchains. In particular, we propose PolyShard: "polynomially coded sharding" scheme that achieves
        information-theoretic upper bounds on the efficiency of the storage, system throughput, as well as on trust, thus
        enabling a truly scalable system. We provide simulation results that numerically demonstrate the performance improvement
        over state of the arts, and the scalability of the PolyShard system. Finally, we discuss potential enhancements, and
        highlight practical considerations in building such a system.
